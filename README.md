# UR10_Imitation_Learning_Demo
This document contains a simple UR10 robot imitation learning example program, which implements the UR10 robot training an LSTM model using teleoperation-collected end-effector trajectories to autonomously draw circles, allowing the robot to start from different initial points and draw circles with a certain level of generalization.
